          Olga Feldman is a visual artist whose practice focuses
          on exploring visual perception through precise
          rhythms, frequency oscillations, and minimalist
          graphic structures. Born in 1980 in Norilsk (Russia)
          where the extreme contrast of polar night and day
          shaped her unique perception of light, color, and
          form. This experience led her to conceptualize the
          world as a system of waves interacting in complex
          interference patterns. She spent most of her life in
          Saint Petersburg and is currently based in Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feldman received a design education at Saint
          Petersburg State University, but her artistic practice
          extends beyond traditional graphic design. Her work
          integrates mathematical precision, influences of Op
          Art, principles of physics, and digital generative
          techniques. Among her key inspirations are Bridget
          Riley, Eyvind Earle, and concepts related to
          oscillations, wave processes and structure of reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          A turning point in her artistic journey was the
          realization of the overwhelming nature of excessive
          visual stimuli, which led her to abandon a saturated
          palette and seek ultimate expressiveness through
          purity of form. This principle became the foundation
          of her artistic language: strict lines, dynamic
          contrasts, rhythmic structures, and a minimalist color
          palette.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her key series include Frequencies, the digital cycle
          An Atomy, the Twisters series, and One of a Kind,
          which explores the phenomenon of human uniqueness.
          Feldman’s early digital works were presented at the
          OFFF Festival in Barcelona, recognized for their
          innovative approach. Her works have since been
          published in various online and print publications.
          Today, Feldman is focused on developing her artistic
          career, continuously exploring new visual strategies
          and deepening her engagement with form, rhythm, and
          perception.

          ARTIST STATEMENT
        </h2>
        <div className="space-y-6">
          <p>
            My artistic practice is deeply rooted in my
            experience in graphic design, where a systematic
            approach and attention to detail are paramount. The
            decision to limit my palette to black and white is a
            conscious one, allowing me to focus on the purity of
            line and the structural integrity of each piece.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work, whether created in acrylic on canvas,
            digital media, or 3D, reflects this pursuit of
            simplicity and minimalism, where each element
            carries depth and meaning. I explore the physics of
            the world: waves, vibrations, and their interference
            patterns, seeking to convey this intricate harmony
            through simple forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            My approach to creation is a fusion of discipline
            and freedom, where rigorous boundaries and conscious
            limitations enable me to explore the depths of
            simplicity and the complexity of harmony. I seek a
            balance between precision and the living line,
            between strict structure and spontaneity, striving
            to convey complex ideas or human emotions through
            simple yet powerful means.
